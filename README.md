# Dotfiles: vim configuration

My config for [noevim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) and [vim](http://www.vim.org/) which I manage via [homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick).

You might use this as a starting point or reference but blindly using this repository will probably not work for you.
